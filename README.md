How to extract data from an Excel File, group the data, save the grouped data and original content into a new Excel File using Python

I was working with a long list (close to 1500 rows) in an excel file. I needed to group them based on a certain criteria. Rather than working directly in the excel, I wanted to use Python to do that for me.

The criteria is to group Clients as a group when their total Savings are less or equal to 450000.

I used Openpyxl library to get this to work.

Disclaimer: The contents in Excel 01 are made up figures. They were created to show how the Python codes work.
